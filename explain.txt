This program was written in PHP without using any package and react for the frontend. Each folder contains an explanation of the operations performed by the files it contains. This application manages the accounting operations in small kiosks easily and smoothly without the need for high data entry effort that may not be available in a small space and financial capabilities work environment. The employee performs a final inventory of the goods in his custody before handing them over to his colleague, which is easy when there is a specific number of items. The employee sends the inventory to the site, which takes care of the necessary accounting operations such as calculating profits and the amount due from the employee and updating the current kiosk stock. The employee's task is limited to this task, while the kiosk owner must register the process of delivering the goods to the employee, adding goods to the owner's stock, adding new items to the stock, and can view a table showing employees and amounts due from them, net profits and date.
