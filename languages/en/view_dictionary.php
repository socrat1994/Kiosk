//I designed this application to manage car
//      maintenance operations within companies. I developed it using native PHP and React
//      to showcase my abilities. You can view the code in my repository and compare it with
//      my previous project to see how I have developed my skills in a period of less than three
//       months. Despite having limited time, I try to make my code clean and compatible with PSR
//       standards
